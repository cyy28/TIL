## 1480 [Sum of 1d Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/running-sum-of-1d-array/)

- Solution 1: 
```python
nums = [1,2,3,4]
sumList = []
currentSum = 0

for i in range(len(nums)):
    currentSum += nums[i]
    sumList.append(currentSum)

return sumList
[1,3,6,10]
```


- Solution 2: 
```python
nums = [1,1,1,1,1]
sumList = []

for i in range(len(nums)):
    sumList.append(sum(nums[:i+1]))

return sumList
[1,2,3,4,5]
```


- Solution 3: 
```python
 nums = [3,1,2,10,1]
for i in range(1, len(nums)):
    nums[i] += nums[i-1]

return nums
[3,4,6,16,17]
```
